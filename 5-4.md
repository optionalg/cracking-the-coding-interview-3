```
So we have ((n & (n-1)) == 0), let's call it f(n)

Suppose n is 101010100.

Then n-1 is:
 101010100
-        1
==========
 101010011

n & (n-1) is:
 101010100
&101010011
==========
 101010000

So n & (n-1) basically clears the least significant 1 bit.

What is ((n & (n-1)) == 0) then? Well, when does n & (n-1) equal 0?
n = 100000000 or 000001000 or 000000001

So when only one bit is 1 and the rest are 0, we have f(n) returning True

Therefore f(n) just checks if n is a power of 2.
